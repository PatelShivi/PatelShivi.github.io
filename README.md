###### Brief Description: My uncle, whose name is Mr.Suresh Patel is running this photo studio since 2017 in India. He always wanted to display his work in different sections. I have created this web portfolio for his studio. I had created about.html page, where I displayed all his work in sections. This web portfolio shows their information. 
                         
###### Difficulties: When I was creating this site, I had found many difficulties. I was not able to receive all his images. So, I decided to take all the images from unslapsh.com.
